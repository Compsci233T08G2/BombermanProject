# BombermanProject
Our project is based on the game Bomberman. The game Bomberman is a multiplayer game where two players traverse a map and break walls to eliminate the other player with a bomb. We have two versions of Bomberman, a text-based version and a GUI-based version. In the text-based version, two players take turns playing the game on a printed arraylist. In the GUI-based version, two players move around a map in real time trying to eliminate each other.
